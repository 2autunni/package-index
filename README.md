WP-CLI Package Index
====================

This repository contains the source code for what you see at <http://wp-cli.org/package-index>.

### Adding your package to the index

Dead simple:

1. Go to the [repositories.txt](https://github.com/wp-cli/package-index/blob/master/repositories.txt) file and press the "Edit" button.
2. Add your package's repository URL to the file.
3. Write a short summary for the change and click "Propose File Change".

The Github UI will take care of forking and opening a pull request for you.
